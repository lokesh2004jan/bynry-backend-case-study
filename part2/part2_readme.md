‚ùì Questions / Clarifications

Do bundles have their own price or use the sum of components?

Can a product have multiple suppliers?

Should inventory logs track who made the change (user ID)?

Low stock threshold: per product or per warehouse?

Are soft deletes needed for products, warehouses, suppliers?

Do we need product variants (size, color)?
